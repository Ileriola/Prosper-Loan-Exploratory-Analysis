# (ProsperLoan Dataset Exploration )
## by (Ileriola Olanrewaju)


## Dataset

> This loan dataset consist of 81 variables on 113,937 loans. The features include: CreditGrade, LoanStatus, BorrowerAPR, BorrowerRate,      
ProsperScore, Occupation, IncomeRange, MonthlyLoanPayment, LoanOriginalAmount amongst others.


## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration, I found that current and completed loans have lower rate than the past-due loans and chargedoff loans. It is also  
worthy to note that the borrower's interest rate is negatively correlated with the amount of loan. The APR decreases when there's a increase 
in loan amount. The loan amount taken is of the average of 5,000, 10,000 and 15,000 and as the point of collection, most of the loan are 
still ongoing. A higher percentage of loan is for 3 years, only a few take loan for a year. In the course of exploration, it was noted that 
the reason most people take these loans is because of debt consolidation among other reasons like: Home improvement, business and others. 
Although, there's an issue of low credit rating it clearly did not cause a default in payment. Most of the borrowers are employed but the 
monthly income distribution is severely right screwed.

> Proportionally, there are more 60 month loans on B and C ratings while there is only 36 months loans for HR rating borrowers. The bulk of 
the ongoing loan comes from those with loan term of 3 years. It also did not really surprise me to note that the higher the Credit Grade, 
the lower the Borrower interest rate tends to be. Working for a company seems to be more beneficial that freelancing or being an 
entreprenuer when borrowing reason been that those employed either full time or part time aeem to have a lower interest rate. The loan 
amount is positively correlated with the stated monthly income, this makes sense since borrowers with more monthly income can borrow more 
money. The loan amount also increased with the increase of loan term. I also found that borrowers with better ratings have larger monthly 
income and loan amount. Employed, self-employed and full time borrowers have more monthly income and loan amount than part-time, retired and 
not employed borrowers.
